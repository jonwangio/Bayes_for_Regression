# Experiment on Bayesian Regression
-------------------
Bayesian epistemology introduces important constraints on top of rational degrees of belief and a rule of probabilistic inference--the principle of conditionalization, according to [William Talbott, 2008](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/).

_Bayesian statistics_ forms a major branch in _statistics_. _Bayesian statistics_ relies on Bayesian principle to reveal a beautiful epistemology scheme through probabilistic inference: one should rationally updates degrees of knowing or belief once new evidence is observed. Mathematically, it is denoted as:

_**P(S|E) = P(E|S)P(S)/P(E)**_

where, _**s**_ can be any arbitrary statement, and _**E**_ is observed evidence(s).

In this small snippet of experiment, the principle of _Bayesian statistics_ is showcased through a prevalent prediction problem: _regression_.
